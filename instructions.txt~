================================================================================
========================================================= Overview and Objective 

For this assignment you will write a program that reads in the data for
planting, harvesting, and pruning plants in an automated food growing
factory. The program is demonstrating a fast and efficient way of handling a
large list of plants while also providing a way to traverse the data structure
in order. You can read background.txt if you want more context for why we are
doing this. For those who have been following along with the story, there is
also an epilogue.txt that describes what happens with the colony. I recommend
reading the epilogue.txt file after you have finished the project.

The objective of this assignment is to learn how to implement and use a
BST. Since this is the objective, you cannot use a premade BST or any other
premade data structure. A secondary objective is to become more familiar with
using char* to represent string data. You cannot use std::string to represent
the strings.

Your program will be evaluated based on both how it runs as well as how it was
designed and implemented. Pay attention to the "rubric.txt" file to see how it
will be evaluated.

Along with these instructions, I have provided datafiles and the EXACT
expected output that corresponds to those datafiles. It is important that
your program output matches EXACTLY. This includes spelling, whitespace, and
punctuation.

The rest of this document provides more details about the assignment. If you
have any questions, be sure to post in the discussion group or send me
email. Do not wait until the last minute to start this assignment.

================================================================================
======================================================================== Details 

The overall situation is that you have a giagantic greenhouse full of planter
boxes where each box has an id number and contains a single plant of one of
the supported plant types (corn, soy, etc.). You are providing software that
makes it easier to manage all the boxes. Your software will support three
actions that can be applied to a planter box: plant, harvest, prune.

The "plant" operation involves planting the requested plant type in a box. We
will always assume that the box starts off as empty.

The "harvest" operation involves harvesting food from a box. In order to be
more efficient, the system always harvests a range of boxes and only a
specified type of food. Harvesting food does not remove the plant from the
box.

The "prune" operation removes a plant from the box that it is in.

This simulation is driven by a main function that reads and processes data
from a datafile. The datafile contains intermixed sections of commands to
plant, harvest, and prune plants from the system. Just as in previous
assignments, I have provided this implementation for you.

The main() function, in planters.cpp, interacts only with a class called
PlanterMgr. It creates an object of that class and then calls plant(),
harvest(), and prune() in various combinations. While that is the only class
that main() sees, it is not the only class in the program. The entire program
will consist of several classes: PlanterMgr, BoxTree, BoxList, and Box.

main() -- this function creates a PlanterMgr and then makes various calls to
the plant(), harvest(), and prune() methods on that object.

PlanterMgr -- this class is the manager of all the plants in the
greenhouse. Internally, it has a variant of a binary search tree that it uses
to store all the boxes of plants. Using a BST allows O(log n) insert and
remove operations. It also allows us to quickly do in-order traversals.

Box -- this class is a simple container that holds a plant. In our program,
each box has an id number and the name of the plant that the box contains.

BoxTree -- this class is a variant of a binary search tree that contains Box
objects. It supports the ability to insert and remove boxes. Also, it supports
a special traversal method that does an in-order traversal of only a portion
of the tree.

BoxList -- this class is a linked list that holds Box objects. This is used
internally when the PlanterMgr asks the BoxTree for a range of Box
objects. The BoxList has an special feature that allows an outside class to
iterate over all the nodes in the list without the caller accessing the
nodes or pointers directly. 

Here is an overview of how the main() function and classes relate to each
other.

main() 		--- calls methods on ---> 	   PlanterMgr
PlanterMgr 	--- contains --->    		   BoxTree
BoxTree 	--- contains --->    		   Box
Box		--- contains --->		   char* (name of plant)

BoxTree.getRange()   --- returns --->   	   BoxList
PlanterMgr.harvest() --- calls methods on --->	   BoxList

The following sections provides details about the requirements for the
assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------------- planters.cpp

The planters.cpp file contains the main application for your program. This
code is meant to read in commands for the simulation (from the provided
datafile). The commands can plant, harvest, and prune plants from the
greenhouse.

The code in planters.cpp interacts with the PlanterMgr only.

You should use the planters.cpp code unchanged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Box

The Box class encapsulates information about a single box. Each Box has a box
number and is intended to hold a single plant. For the purposes of this
simulation we only care about the name of the plant. This should be stored as
a char* in the box class. Since a Box without a plant might make sense in some
situations (but it doesn't happen in this assignment), it is ok to have a Box
constructor that takes no arguments. In this case set the box number to 0 and
the name to the empty string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ BoxTree

The BoxTree class is a variant of a binary search tree where each node
contains a Box. The BoxTree should supply the standard BST operations for
inserting and removing items from the tree. Also, it should provide an
in-order traversal method that returns, in order, a list of Boxes between two
numbers. For example:

  BoxTree bt;
  // code to insert stuff....
  BoxList bl = bt.getRange(203,515);

The call to getRange() here would return a BoxList (linked list) that contains
all the boxes in the tree starting with box 203 and ending with box 515
(including those numbers). It is important to note that this traversal must
not traverse the entire tree. It must traverse just the part of the tree in
the given range.

Also note that while a BoxTree holds Box objects, it doesn't really know what
is in a Box. It knows it has a number but other than that, the rest of the
data in a Box is irrelevant to the BoxTree. This should be reflected in the
BoxTree API. For example, the insert() method should accept a fully created
Box object rather than an int for the ID and a char* for the plant name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ BoxList

The BoxList class is essentially a linked list that holds Box objects. As a
linked list it supports the customary add, remove, and search operations. It
also has a feature built in that lets caller code iterate over all the nodes
without the caller actually using the node struct or pointers. This is done by
providing three additional methods:

    void startIterating();	  
    const Box& getNextBox();
    bool hasNextBox();

From a caller point of view, these methods are used like this:

    BoxList bl;  // we get this from somewhere
    bl.startIterating();
    while (bl.hasNextBox()) {
      const Box& box = bl.getNextBox();
      cout << box.getPlantName() << endl;
    }

The way that this works is that the BoxList class has a data member called
mCurrent that is a pointer to a node. This member is used to point to the
"next" Box object. When someone calls startIterating(), the mCurrent pointer
is set to head. When someone calls hasNextBox(), the method returns true if
mCurrent is non-null, false otherwise. When someone calls getNextBox(), the
method returns the Box in the node that mCurrent is pointing to and then moves
mCurrent to the next node. It is an error if the calling code calls
getNextBox() when mCurrent is nullptr.

--------------------------------------------------------------------- PlanterMgr

The PlanterMgr class manages all the planter boxes in the system. It has three
public methods: plant(), harvest(), and prune(). The PlanterMgr class uses a
BoxTree object to store all the planter boxes. Implementation of each of the
public methods is fairly straight-forward.

The plant() method accepts a box number and a plant name. It then creates a
Box object with that data and calls the BoxTree::insert() method. It prints a
message indicating that the plant was planted.

The harvest() method is the trickiest. This method accepts a range of box
numbers and the name of a plant. It first calls BoxTree::getRange() with the
start and stop numbers. That method call returns a BoxList of zero or more
nodes. Then the harvest() method uses the BoxTree iteration methods (see the
BoxList description) to iterate over the returned list. For each Box, it
checks to see if that Box plant name matches the one passed to harvest(). If
so, then it prints a message that that plant is being harvested.

In doing the harvest iteration it is important that the PlanterMgr class does
not know anything about the nodes in either the BoxTree or the BoxList. It
only uses the public API of each of those classes to do what needs to be done.

The prune() method accepts a box number. It calls BoxTree::remove() with that
box number. It prints a message indicating that the plant was pruned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------- Other Files

I have provided test programs as well. These test programs will most likely
not work with your classes out-of-the-box. I only provide them to give you a
rough example of how you can write small test programs for your classes.

You are not required to use the test programs but I highly recommend it. You
should not turn in the test programs. I will not evaluate or grade them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- DataFiles

The datafiles for this project are more complex than in the previous
projects. Each datafile has multiple sections. Each section is marked with
"start_section" and "end_section". The data within the section is different
for each type of section. There are three types of sections: planting,
harvesting, pruning.

The planting section looks like this:

start_planting
92741 corn
62642 soy
end_planting

This plants corn in box 92741 and soy in box 62642. 

The harvesting section looks like this:

start_harvest
chive 48223 58268
lettuce 10112 37192
end_harvest

This harvests all chive plants between 48223 and 58268, if any. It also
harvests all lettuce plants between 10112 and 37192, if any.

The pruning section looks like this:

start_pruning
91270
42987
end_pruning

This prunes the plant in box 91270 and 42987 (that is, it removes them from
the BST).

Each section can have any number of entries. There can be multiple instances
of each section in the datafile. The box numbers in each section are not in
numerical order.

This datafile format is handled properly by the provided planters.cpp
file. If you want to make your own datafiles, you will need to follow this
format.

================================================================================
========================================================================== Tasks

In this section I outline the sequence of tasks that you should follow to
complete this project. After each task (except the first one) you should be
able to compile and run your program. Also, at each task step, you should use
valgrind to make sure that you don't have any memory errors or leaks.

To help you pace yourself, I've added estimates of about how long I think each
of these tasks takes an average student.

Task 1: Read and Understand (1 hr)

    The primary objective of this task is to gain a full understanding of the
    assignment requirements.
    
    Read (and understand) each of the documents in this assignment:

    - instructions.txt (this document)
    - background.txt
    - rubric.txt

    Read the "planters.cpp" file to see how it works.

    Examine medium.txt to see what the data is like in the datafile and
    medium.txt.out to familiarize yourself with the output format.

Task 2: Create the PlanterMgr class stub (1 hr)

    The primary objective of this task is to get the main program to build. It
    won't do anything yet but it will provide a foundation for building on.
     
    Create a new class for PlanterMgr using the details for this class as
    described above. Don't create complete implementations of each of the
    methods, only create stub implementations. Since you haven't created the
    BoxTree class yet, you can't add that data member to the class.

    You should be able to compile the whole program without errors. If you run
    the program with one of the datafiles it will not do anything useful but
    you can do this anyway to make sure that there aren't any memory errors or
    leaks.

Task 3: Create the Box class (1 hr)

    The objective of this task is to create the Box class. This is the
    fundamental unit of data that the program deals with.
    
    Create a new class (separate header and implementation files) for Box. The
    details for this class are described above. Since this class contains
    pointer data, you will have to provide a destructor. You will also have to
    implement or delete (using the delete keyword) the copy constructor and
    assignment operator.

    At this point you can still compile the entire program but it still won't
    do much. This would be a good time to modify and use testbox.cpp.

Task 4: Create the BoxTree class with stubs only (2 hr)

    The objective of this class is to build a placeholder BST that will hold
    Box objects.
    
    Create a BoxTree class definition with the following methods in the
    header file:

    - default constructor
    - copy constructor (possibly deleted)
    - destructor 
    - operator= (possibly deleted)
    - insert
    - remove
    - getRange

    Define the node struct or class for your BoxTree so that it has three data
    members: a Box data object (or a pointer to a Box, your choice) and
    left/right child pointers

    Define the root for your BoxTree class:

      Node* root

    Create a "boxtree.cpp" file with an implementation for default
    constructor, destructor and stub implementations of each of the other
    methods.

    Add a BoxTree data member to PlanterMgr. You will have to add the
    appropriate #include statement to plantermgr.cpp.

    You can compile the entire program but it still won't do much yet. You
    have most of the scaffolding in place but there's not much functionality
    implemented.

    If you are using the test programs, you should modify the testboxtree.cpp
    file to match your class and compile and run that.
    
    Use valgrind to check for memory errors and memory leaks. Make sure that
    you don't have any before moving on to the next tasks.

Task 5: Implement the BoxTree::insert method (2 hr)

    The objective of this task is to add the insert functionality to the
    BoxTree and integrate that with the PlanterMgr::plant() method.
    
    Implement the BoxTree::insert method using the techniques that you've
    learned for inserting a node into a binary search tree. The BoxTree holds
    Box objects but it doesn't know what is in a Box other than the number
    (which is uses for ordering). The insert() method should take the Box
    object as an argument instead of the plant name and box number.
        
    If you're using the test program. Update it to make calls to
    BoxTree::insert().
    
    Now that you have insert working, update PersonMgr::plant() to print the
    correct message, create a Box object for the plant, and insert the new Box
    into the tree.

    Your program should produce all the correct output for the planting
    messages now. You should make sure that it runs without any memory errors
    or leaks before moving on to the next task.

Task 6: Implement the BoxTree::remove method (2 hr)

    The objective of this task is to add the remove functionality to the
    BoxTree and integrate that with the PlanterMgr::prune() method.
    
    Implement the BoxTree::remove method using the techniques that you've
    learned for removing a node from a binary search tree.

    If you're using the test program. Update it to make calls to
    BoxTree::remove().
    
    Now that you have remove working, update PersonMgr::prune() to print the
    correct message and remove the box from the tree.

    Your program should produce all the correct output for the planting and
    pruning messages now. You should make sure that it runs without any memory
    errors or leaks.

Task 7: Implement the BoxList (2 hr)

    The objective of this task is to implement the BoxList class.

    The BoxList class is simply a LinkedList that holds Box objects plus a few
    methods that allow client code to iterate over the list without explicitly
    accessing the internal nodes or pointers.

    Start by implementing a standard LinkedList with the insertAtTail method
    and the destructor. There is no need for any other insertion or removal
    methods.

    Normally, you can delete the copy constructor and assignment operator for
    a LinkedList but that won't work for this. The BoxTree::getRange() method
    (see the next task) returns a BoxList object by value and this requires a
    copy. This means that you will need to implement the BoxList copy
    constructor. You can delete the assignment operator (unless you add other
    code in your implementation that requires it).

    Reread the description of the BoxList class in the Details section of the
    assignment to remind yourself about the "iteration methods". In order to
    implement these the BoxList needs an extra data member, mCurrent, that is
    a pointer to a node in the list. This pointer is "the next value to give
    to the caller".

    Implement startIterating() so that it sets that pointer to head.

    Implement getNextBox() so that if that pointer is not nullptr, the Box
    object (or a const pointer to it) in that node is returned.
    
    Implement hasNextBox() so that if mCurrent is nullptr, it returns
    false. Otherwise it returns true.

    After completing this implementation, you should be able to compile and
    run your main program. It doesn't use the BoxList yet so there shouldn't
    be any change.

Task 8: Implement the BoxTree::getRange method (4 hr)

    The objective of this task is to add the getRange functionality to the
    BoxTree method.
    
    Implement the BoxTree::getRange method. The public method for getRange()
    should accept a starting box number and an ending box number. It should
    return a BoxList object. That is, the method signature in BoxTree should
    be:

      BoxList getRange(const int start,const int stop);

    The getRange() method is a variant of an in-order traversal. The idea is
    to access the nodes in the tree, in order, but only from the starting box
    number to the ending box number (including the end numbers). While
    traversing over the range, the getRange() method adds the Box in each node
    traversed to the end of the BoxList. When the traversal is done, the
    BoxList object should contain a list of all the Box objects in order. This
    BoxList object should be returned.

    Since tree traversal algorithms are usually recursive, they usually accept
    the "root" as one of the arguments. As described in the book, this doesn't
    make sense for a public method since callers of the method don't have
    access to the tree's root. The common technique is to have a public
    non-recursive method that just calls an internal (private) recursive
    method and passes in the root.

    For the getRange() method you will use this technique. In addition, your
    getRange() method will need to create a BoxList object and pass that as an
    argument to the internal recursive traversal algorithm. The internal
    recursive algorithm needs this BoxList argument so that it can add the
    nodes to it.
    
    It is very important that the traversal only looks at the fewest nodes as
    possible. That is, it should NOT traverse the whole tree. It should limit
    the traversal to just the specified range.

    After you implement getRange(), you should be able to compile your whole
    program and run it. At this point you haven't made any calls from
    PlanterMgr to getRange() -- that is the next task -- so there shouldn't be
    any change in the overall program behavior.

Task 9: Integrate getRange() with PlanterMgr::harvest() (2 hr)

    The objective of this task is to implement the harvest method using the
    BoxTree::getRange() method.

    The BoxTree::getRange() method returns a BoxList object. The BoxList class
    provides three methods for iterating over the Box objects that it
    contains. See the description of BoxList for details about these
    methods.

    Implement the PlanterMgr::harvest() method by calling BoxTree::getRange()
    to get a BoxList of the Box objects that might be harvested. Next, use the
    BoxList methods to traverse the list and for each Box that has a matching
    plant name, print an appropriate message.

    All the functionality for your program should be complete now. Make sure
    that you can run it against all the provided datafiles and that the
    generated output matches the provided output files exactly.

    Also ensure that valgrind doesn't show any memory errors or leaks.

    Finally, review the rubric.txt file to make sure that all of requirements
    are met.

Task 10: Final check (? hr)

    You are done!
